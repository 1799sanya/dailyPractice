/*NOTES:
When reversing a number like x = 1534236469, the reversed result is 9646324351 â€” which exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE (2,147,483,647).
Since the environment doesn't allow 64-bit integers, you can't use long to store the reversed number.
If: rev * 10 + ld > Integer.MAX_VALUE (if we perform this check directly)
then overflow will happen, and we must return 0 before doing it.
But we can't write that check directly, because rev * 10 + ld might itself overflow while checking!
So instead, we rearrange the inequality to check before we multiply:
rev > (Integer.MAX_VALUE - ld) / 10
This ensures that rev * 10 + ld would be within bounds.
